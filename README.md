## Development

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build the app
npm run build

# This creates a distributable Electron app
```

### Scripts

- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No access token available"** - Make sure you've completed the Spotify OAuth flow
2. **"No Music Playing"** - Start playing music on any Spotify client first
3. **Images not loading** - Check that Spotify image domains are allowed in next.config.ts
4. **OAuth redirect fails** - Verify the redirect URI matches exactly in your Spotify app settings

### Need Help?

- Check the browser console for error messages
- Ensure your Spotify app has the correct redirect URI
- Make sure you have an active Spotify Premium account (required for playback control)
